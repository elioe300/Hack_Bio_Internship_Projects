## Amino Acid with Highest Impact:

# Glycine (G) is a small and flexible amino acid that significantly impacts protein structure by allowing tight turns and facilitating folding. It is found 1307 times.

## Structural and Functional Properties of Amino Acids with >100 Occurrences:

# Glycine (G): Small and flexible, aids in protein folding.

# Leucine (L): Hydrophobic, stabilizes protein core.

# Isoleucine (I): Hydrophobic, contributes to structural stability.

# Arginine (R): Basic, involved in binding phosphate groups.

# Proline (P): Causes kinks in protein chains, disrupts regular structures.

# Alanine (A): Small, helps in stabilizing protein structure.

# Tyrosine (Y): Polar, involved in signaling and enzyme activity.

# Valine (V): Hydrophobic, stabilizes protein structure.

# Tryptophan (W): Largest amino acid, involved in protein-protein interactions.
