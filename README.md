## Stage 1 -> Functions Galore!
## Overview
This project consists of several functions:
- A function to **translate DNA sequences into protein sequences**.
- A function that **simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve**.
- A function to **determine the time to reach 80% of the carrying capacity** in a population.
- A function to **calculate the Hamming distance** between two strings (e.g., a Slack username and a Twitter/X handle).
